# database-cleanup-system
This project is a backend-driven data cleaning tool built with FastAPI, Docker, and Pandas. It allows users to upload large CSV datasets (~70,000 rows), automatically clean them by removing invalid emails based on brand-specific rules, and preview or export the cleaned data.
